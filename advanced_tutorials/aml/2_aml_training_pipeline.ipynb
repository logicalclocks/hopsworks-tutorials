You will train a model on the created training dataset. You will train your model using TensorFlow, although it could just as well be trained with other machine learning frameworks such as Scikit-learn, Keras, and PyTorch. You will also see some of the exploration that can be done in Hopsworks, notably the search functions and the lineage.</span>\n",
