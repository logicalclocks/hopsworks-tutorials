# Real time feature computation using Apache Beam, Google Cloud Dataflow and Hopsworks Feature Store

## Introduction
In this guide you will learn how to create Real-Time Feature Engineering pipeline and write real time features in to
the Hopsworks features store. This guide covers creating a

- computing real time features with Apache Beam using Google Cloud Dataflow.
- writing real time features to Hopsworks's online feature store using `hsfs-beam` library.

You will also
- create feature group using the HSFS APIs.
- Backfill feature data to offline feature group.

## Before you begin Ensure that:

- Google Cloud CLI is installed.
- You Have Google Cloud account
- Google Cloud project is enabled with Compute Engine, Dataflow, Pub/Sub APIs and the associated 
  service account has the role to utilize these APIs

You also need to have configured maven; java 1.8 and git.

## Clone tutorials repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/logicalclocks/hopsworks-tutorials
cd ./hopsworks-tutorials/integrations/java/beam
mvn clean package
```

## Create a Feature Group
Currently, Beam support for Hopsworks feature store is experimental and only write operation is supported. This means
that Feature group metadata needs to be registered in Hopsworks Feature store before you can write real time features computed
by Bytewax.

Full documentation how to create feature group using HSFS APIs can be found [here](https://docs.hopsworks.ai/3.4/user_guides/fs/feature_group/create/).

This tutorial comes with a python program to create a feature group:
- `python ./setup/feature_group.py`

## Data source
Feature pipeline needs to connect to some data source to read the data to be processed. In this tutorial you will
use publicly available topic `projects/pubsub-public-data/topics/taxirides-realtime`. Ensure that the associated 
service account has the Pub/Sub Admin role. 

## Start Beam/DataFlow streaming pipeline:

### Google Cloud Pub/Sub to Google Cloud Storage
Now you ready to run a streaming pipeline using Beam and Google Cloud Dataflow. For this you need to
have Hopsworks cluster host address, hopsworks project name and [api key](https://docs.hopsworks.ai/3.3/user_guides/projects/api_key/create_api_key/)

Once you have the above define environment variables:

```bash
HOPSWORKS_HOST=c.app.hopsworks.ai
HOPSWORKS_API_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_HOPSWORKS_API_KEY
HOPSWORKS_PROJECT_NAME=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_HOPSWORKS_PROJECT_NAME
```

You will write real time feature data to feature group `taxi_ride` version `1`.
```bash
FEATURE_GROUP_NAME=taxi_ride
FEATURE_GROUP_VERSION=1
```

As we mentioned above your beam pipeline will read raw data from  publicly available `taxirides-realtime` topic 
```bash
SOURCE_TOPIC=projects/pubsub-public-data/topics/taxirides-realtime
```

Define required environment variables for your google cloud account:
```bash
# GCP application credentials file
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=REPLACE_WITH_PATH_TO_YOUR_CREDENTIALS_FILE
# Google Cloud project ID to run the pipeline on. You can get this by: gcloud config get-value project
export PROJECT_NAME=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID
```

### Real time feature engineering in Beam/DataFlow
Apache Beam is a powerful and flexible unified programming model for batch and streaming data processing pipelines.

Currently, Beam pipelines for Hopsworks Feature store are supported only in Java. Hopsworks Feature Store expects that 
your aggregation result is encapsulated in `org.apache.beam.sdk.values.Row` class and that it has the same schema as 
the feature group you are writing into. 

For example when you executed python code `./setup/feature_group.py` you created feature group
`taxi_ride` that has the following schema:

```
root
   |-- ride_id: string (nullable = true)
   |-- ride_status: string (nullable = true)
   |-- point_idx: integer (nullable = true)
   |-- longitude: double (nullable = true)
   |-- latitude: double (nullable = true)
   |-- meter_reading: double (nullable = true)
   |-- meter_increment: double (nullable = true)
   |-- passenger_count: integer (nullable = true)
```

This means that Hopsworks Feature store expects `org.apache.beam.sdk.values.Row` class with the following schema from 
Beam application to be able to write in `taxi_ride` feature group:

```java
Schema schema =
  Schema.of(
  Field.nullable("ride_id", FieldType.STRING),
  Field.nullable("ride_status", FieldType.STRING),
  Field.nullable("point_idx", FieldType.INT32),
  Field.nullable("longitude", FieldType.DOUBLE),
  Field.nullable("latitude", FieldType.DOUBLE),
  Field.nullable("meter_reading", FieldType.DOUBLE),
  Field.nullable("meter_increment", FieldType.DOUBLE),
  Field.nullable("passenger_count", FieldType.INT32)
  );
```

In the `com.hopsworks.tutorials.beam.TaxiRideInsertStream` you will find end to end code how to:
- read from source topic.
- convert to `org.apache.beam.sdk.values.Row` class with expected schema.
- get feature group handle and write real time features in to the online feature store.

To submit beam pipeline and write real time features to`taxi_ride` feature group execute the following command.

```bash
mvn compile exec:java \
  -Dexec.mainClass=com.hopsworks.tutorials.beam.TaxiRideInsertStream \
  -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false \
  -Dexec.args="\
    --hopsworksHost=$HOPSWORKS_HOST \
    --hopsworksApi=$HOPSWORKS_API_KEY \
    --hopsworksProject=$HOPSWORKS_PROJECT_NAME \
    --featureGroupName=$FEATURE_GROUP_NAME \
    --featureGroupVersion=$FEATURE_GROUP_VERSION \
    --inputTopic=$SOURCE_TOPIC \
    --project=$PROJECT_NAME \
    --runner=DataflowRunner"
```

#### Backfill feature data to offline FG
Above pipeline writes real time features to online feature store that stores the latest values per primary key(s). 
To save historical data for batch data analysis or model training you need to start backfill job. You can do this 
from Hopsworks jobs UI or CLI. 

To start Hopsworks job 1st make sure that you have Hopsworks Python library installed in your environment:
```bash
pip install hopsworks
```

Then execute the following command:
```bash
python3 ./materialization_job_client.py --api_key $HOPSWORKS_API_KEY --jobname ${FEATURE_GROUP_NAME}_${FEATURE_GROUP_VERSION}_offline_fg_materialization
```

## Cleanup to avoid incurring charges to your GCP account for the resources created in this tutorial:
- `Ctrl+C` to stop the program in your terminal. Note that this does not actually stop the job if you use 
  `DataflowRunner`.
- Stop the Dataflow job in [GCP Console Dataflow page]. Cancel the job instead of draining it. This may take some 
  minutes.
- make sure to delete all VMs created by DataflowRunner (if any).
