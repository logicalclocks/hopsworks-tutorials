Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.
In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience you will predict clients' repayment abilities.
Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.

## <span style="color:#ff5f27;">🗒️ This whole tutorial is divided into 5 parts:</span>

1. How to backfill Features to the Feature Store.
2. How to create a feature pipeline.
3. How to create Feature View & Training Datasets, train a model and upload it to the Model Registry.


You will load data into the **Feature Store**, create `Feature Groups` from which you will make a `Feature View` and `Training Dataset`.

Then you will train a model to predict clients' repayment abilities.

Also, you will design a data-generation pipeline, that will be running once a time using **GitHub Actions** and insert a new generated data into existing `Feature Groups`.

This is a batch use case, it will give you a high-level view of how to use our Python APIs and the UI to navigate.
