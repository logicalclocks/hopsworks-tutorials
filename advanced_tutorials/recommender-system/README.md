#### In this tutorial, you will build a recommender system for fashion items Using Hopsworks. It is divided into the following parts:

* 1_feature_engineering.ipynb
* 2_train_retrieval_model.ipynb
* 3_embeddings_creation.ipynb
* 4_train_ranking_model.ipynb
* 5_create_deployments.ipynb
* 6_inference_and_ui.py

#### Streamlit App

Use the following commands in the terminal to launch the Streamlit application:

`cd {%path_to_recommender_system_tutorial%}`

`streamlit run 6_inference_and_ui.py`


## Before you begin
For the tutorials to work, you need:
- Hopsworks account
  [managed.hopsworks.ai](https://managed.hopsworks.ai) account or on premise Hopsworks deployment. Note that this tutorial
  will not work for [app.hopsworks.ai](https://app.hopsworks.ai) account as submitting custom jobs to
  [app.hopsworks.ai](https://app.hopsworks.ai) are not supported.
