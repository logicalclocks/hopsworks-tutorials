    "Models can be served via KFServing or \"default\" serving, which means a Docker container exposing a Flask server. For KFServing models, or models written in Tensorflow, you do not need to write a prediction file (see the section below). However, for sklearn models using default serving, you do need to proceed to write a prediction file.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Create the Prediction File\n",
    "In order to deploy a model, you need to write a Python file containing the logic to return a prediction from the model. Don't worry, this is usually a matter of just modifying some paths in a template script. An example can be seen in the code block below, where we have taken this Scikit-learn template script and changed two paths (see comments)."
